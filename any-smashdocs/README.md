## Task notes

As discussed I'm sending you our coding challenge.\
It would be best if you spend like 2 - 3 hours on it and send over the project files
with your thoughts and remarks (as comment, text or E-Mail) about the excercises.
If you like to spend more time, you can of course.

Feel free to change anything you like on the project files.

## If you have questions just drop me or my collegues a line or ask on Skype.
