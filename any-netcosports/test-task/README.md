# Simple Video Player

This project is meant to show an understanding and ability to use the html `<video>` tag and its API.

## TODO:

* [] Natives controls must be hidden
* [] A personalised progress bar must be visible and must be updated during playback
* [] A custom play/pause button(s) must be implemented and control the video
* [] Implementation with vanilla javascript (document.querySelector..) or React (jQuery forbidden !!)
* [] Some units testing. (mocha.. )
* [] Code hosted on github
* [] A small description on how you would implement the deployment of your player. (Build, infrastructure, servers, continuous integration, environnements (prod, test..), etc..) 3 or 4 lines
* [] All “bundle” tools are allowed: webpack, browserify, bower, npm, gulp..
* [] Bonus: An “end to end” test: Check that if I load the player, the button(s) play/pause is visible (nightwatch.js, etc...)
