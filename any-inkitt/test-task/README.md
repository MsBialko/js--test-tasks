**Build a small tool that will do the following:**
 - Allow the user to select any text on an article
 - Show a custom menu with a twitter sharing button next to the selected text
 - After clicking the sharing button, the Twitter “sharing window” should appear with the selected text prefilled, ready to be tweeted.
 - Make it as beautiful as possible (Get inspired by medium.com)

**Requirements:**
Build the solution on pure JS, without using any libraries (except twitter SDK for sharing)
